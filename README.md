\# Password Cracking \& Credential Attack Suite



\## 📌 Project Overview

The Password Cracking \& Credential Attack Suite is a Python-based security auditing framework designed to simulate real-world password attacks in a controlled and ethical environment.



The project demonstrates how weak passwords are exploited and how organizations can strengthen authentication security.



This project follows both Red Team (attack simulation) and Blue Team (defensive analysis) perspectives.
