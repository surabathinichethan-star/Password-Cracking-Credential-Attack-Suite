\# Password Cracking \& Credential Attack Suite



\## 📌 Project Overview

The Password Cracking \& Credential Attack Suite is a Python-based security auditing framework designed to simulate real-world password attacks in a controlled and ethical environment.



The project demonstrates how weak passwords are exploited and how organizations can strengthen authentication security.



This project follows both Red Team (attack simulation) and Blue Team (defensive analysis) perspectives.

\## 🎯 Project Objectives

\- Generate custom password dictionaries

\- Simulate password hashing mechanisms

\- Perform controlled brute-force attack simulations

\- Analyze password strength using entropy and complexity

\- Generate professional security audit reports

\- Recommend secure password policies



---



\## 🧰 Tools \& Technologies

\- Programming Language: Python

\- Libraries: hashlib, itertools, math, re, datetime

\- Platform: Windows

\- Version Control: Git \& GitHub

\## 🗂️ Project Structure

Got it — this is the real issue now, and it’s very clear:



👉 Your README.md file exists, but it is EMPTY on GitHub.

That’s why nothing is rendering.

GitHub is not hiding it anymore — there is simply no content inside it.



This is not a Git bug. It’s just an empty file.



Let’s fix this once and for all.



✅ FINAL, DEFINITIVE FIX (DO EXACTLY THIS)



We will:



Put content into README.md



Make sure Git tracks that change



Push it



Verify rendering



STEP 1 — Open README.md LOCALLY



In PowerShell (project root):



notepad README.md



What you should see



If the file opens blank → that’s the problem



If there is no text at all → expected based on your message



STEP 2 — PASTE THE README CONTENT (MANDATORY)



Copy everything below and paste it into the open Notepad window.

\## ⚙️ Modules Description



\### Dictionary Generator

Generates custom password wordlists using user inputs and mutation rules.



\### Hash Generator

Creates cryptographic hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512) from plaintext passwords.



\### Brute-Force Simulator

Simulates brute-force attacks against hashed passwords in a controlled environment.



\### Password Strength Analyzer

Evaluates password complexity, entropy, and assigns a security risk level.



\### Audit Report Generator

Generates a password security audit report with findings and recommendations.
