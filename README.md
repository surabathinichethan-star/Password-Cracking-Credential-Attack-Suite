\# Password Cracking \& Credential Attack Suite



\## 📌 Project Overview

The Password Cracking \& Credential Attack Suite is a Python-based security auditing framework designed to simulate real-world password attacks in a \*\*controlled and ethical environment\*\*.



The project helps understand how weak passwords are exploited and how organizations can strengthen authentication security.



This project follows both \*\*Red Team (attack simulation)\*\* and \*\*Blue Team (defensive analysis)\*\* perspectives.

\## ⚙️ Modules Description



\### 1️⃣ Dictionary Generator

\- Generates custom wordlists based on user input

\- Applies mutation rules (uppercase, numbers, symbols, leetspeak)

\- Simulates real-world password profiling



\### 2️⃣ Hash Generator

\- Converts plaintext passwords into cryptographic hashes

\- Supports MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512

\- Demonstrates how passwords are stored securely



\### 3️⃣ Brute-Force Attack Simulator

\- Performs controlled brute-force simulations

\- Uses hashes instead of plaintext passwords

\- Calculates number of attempts and time-to-crack



\### 4️⃣ Password Strength Analyzer

\- Evaluates password complexity and entropy

\- Assigns risk levels (CRITICAL, WEAK, MEDIUM, STRONG)

\- Identifies weaknesses and missing security controls



\### 5️⃣ Audit Report Generator

\- Generates a professional security audit report

\- Includes findings, risk assessment, and remediation steps

\- Mimics real SOC / security audit documentation
